1. Open Remix (https://remix.ethereum.org)
2. Create ColdChainProof.sol and paste contract
3. Compile with compiler 0.8.20 (enable optimization)
4. Deploy using Injected Provider (MetaMask) on Sepolia
5. After deploy, copy the contract address and the ABI
6. Paste the ABI into backend/contract_abi.json and set CONTRACT_ADDRESS in backend/.env
7. Add SEPOLIA_RPC (Infura/Alchemy) and WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY & WALLET_ADDRESS to environment
8. Test by sending a POST to /api/data with a payload that triggers an alert (temperature > 8 or < -5 or door_state == "open")
